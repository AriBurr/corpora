\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Mark but this flea, and mark in this,\'a0\'a0\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 How little that which thou deniest me is;\'a0\'a0\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 It sucked me first, and now sucks thee,\cb1 \
\cb3 And in this flea our two bloods mingled be;\'a0\'a0\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 Thou know\'92st that this cannot be said\cb1 \
\cb3 A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead,\cb1 \
\cb3 \'a0\'a0\'a0 Yet this enjoys before it woo,\cb1 \
\cb3 \'a0\'a0\'a0 And pampered swells with one blood made of two,\cb1 \
\cb3 \'a0\'a0\'a0 And this, alas, is more than we would do.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Oh stay, three lives in one flea spare,\cb1 \
\cb3 Where we almost, nay more than married are.\'a0\'a0\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 This flea is you and I, and this\cb1 \
\cb3 Our marriage bed, and marriage temple is;\'a0\'a0\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 Though parents grudge, and you, w'are met,\'a0\'a0\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 And cloistered in these living walls of jet.\cb1 \
\cb3 \'a0\'a0\'a0 Though use make you apt to kill me,\cb1 \
\cb3 \'a0\'a0\'a0 Let not to that, self-murder added be,\cb1 \
\cb3 \'a0\'a0\'a0 And sacrilege, three sins in killing three.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Cruel and sudden, hast thou since\cb1 \
\cb3 Purpled thy nail, in blood of innocence?\'a0\'a0\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 Wherein could this flea guilty be,\cb1 \
\cb3 Except in that drop which it sucked from thee?\'a0\'a0\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 Yet thou triumph\'92st, and say'st that thou\'a0\'a0\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 Find\'92st not thy self, nor me the weaker now;\cb1 \
\cb3 \'a0\'a0\'a0 \'92Tis true; then learn how false, fears be:\cb1 \
\cb3 \'a0\'a0\'a0 Just so much honor, when thou yield\'92st to me,\cb1 \
\cb3 \'a0\'a0\'a0 Will waste, as this flea\'92s death took life from thee.\
